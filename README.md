# To-Do App

A complete React Todo App with TypeScript that allows you to manage todos using an API. This project implements adding, deleting, renaming, and toggling the status of todos, including a “toggle all” feature. Each action shows a loader while waiting for the API response and displays error notifications in case of failure.

The app demonstrates a fully functional React + TypeScript project with proper state management, API integration, and user-friendly interactions.
